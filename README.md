**The subject of this project consisted in comparing and analyzing the average temperatures measured both globally around the world and locally, in Munich/Germany, where I live.** 

The aim of this introduction project, was to perform a first analysis while learning to master skills like:
  - aquiring data from a SQL Database
  - importing data from csv Files into Exel/Google Sheets
  - mastering basic statistic operations and generate visualizations       within Exel/Google Sheets


The steps taken to achieve this analysis are described in the project report file: _"Project\_Weather\_Trends.pdf"_

I also included the _csv_ files for global and local temperatures I generated from the SQL queries _"global.csv"_ and _"munich.csv"_, as well as the google sheet I used, for computing moving averages and generating linear plots _"ExploreWeatherTrends.xslx"_
